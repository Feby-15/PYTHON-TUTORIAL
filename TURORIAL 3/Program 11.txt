Q.11) Write a Python program to find the quadrant of a point, say (x,y).

def find_quadrant(x, y):
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        return "Quadrant I"
    elif x < 0 and y > 0:
        return "Quadrant II"
    elif x < 0 and y < 0:
        return "Quadrant III"
    elif x > 0 and y < 0:
        return "Quadrant IV"
    elif x == 0 and y == 0:
        return "The point is at the origin"
    elif x == 0:
        return "The point is on the Y-axis"
    else:
        return "The point is on the X-axis"


x = float(input("Enter the x coordinate: "))
y = float(input("Enter the y coordinate: "))

result = find_quadrant(x, y)
print(result)
