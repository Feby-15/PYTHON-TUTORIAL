Q.18) Write a Python program to print the factorial of a number using recursion.




def Fact(n):
   
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
 
    else:
        return n * Fact(n - 1)

Num = int(input("Enter a number to find its factorial: "))


Result = Fact(Num)

print(f"The factorial of {Num} is: {Result}")
