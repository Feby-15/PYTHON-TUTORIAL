Q.11) Write a Python program which takes a positive integer n as input and finds
the sum of cubes of all positive even numbers less than or equal to the
number.



def Sum_Cubes_Evens(n):
    total = 0
    for num in range(2, n + 1, 2):  
        total += num ** 3  
    return total


n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))


if n <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
    
    Result = Sum_Cubes_Evens(n)
    print(f"The sum of cubes of all positive even numbers less than or equal to {n} is: {Result}")
