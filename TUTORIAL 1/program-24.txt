Q.24) Write a Python program to print all numbers between 100 and 1000 whose sum of
digits is divisible by 9



def Sum_of_Digits (Num):
    
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(Num))
    
    
    return digit_sum % 9 == 0


for Num in range(100, 1000):
    if Sum_of_Digits (Num):
        print(Num, end=" ")
