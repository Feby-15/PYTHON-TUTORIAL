Q.18) Consider a CSV file ‘weather.csv’ with the following
columns (date,temperature, humidity, windSpeed,precipitationType, place, weather {Rainy,Cloudy, Sunny}).
Write commands to do the following using Pandas library.

1. Print first 10 rows of weather data.
2. Find the maximum and minimum temperature
3. List the places with temperature less than 28oC.
4. List the places with weather = “Cloudy”
5. Sort and display each weather and its frequency
6. Create a bar plot to visualize temperature of each day



import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('weather.csv')

# 1. Print first 10 rows of weather data
print("First 10 rows of weather data:")
print(df.head(10))

# 2. Find the maximum and minimum temperature
max_temp = df['temperature'].max()
min_temp = df['temperature'].min()
print("\nMaximum Temperature:", max_temp)
print("Minimum Temperature:", min_temp)

# 3. List the places with temperature less than 28°C
places_below_28 = df[df['temperature'] < 28]['place']
print("\nPlaces with temperature less than 28°C:")
print(places_below_28)

# 4. List the places with weather = "Cloudy"
cloudy_places = df[df['weather'] == "Cloudy"]['place']
print("\nPlaces with weather = 'Cloudy':")
print(cloudy_places)

# 5. Sort and display each weather and its frequency
weather_frequency = df['weather'].value_counts().sort_index()
print("\nWeather frequency:")
print(weather_frequency)

# 6. Create a bar plot to visualize the temperature of each day
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['date'], df['temperature'], color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.title('Temperature of Each Day')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
