Q.17) Consider the above student.csv file with fields Name,Branch, Year, CGPA .
Write python code using pandas to 

To find the average CGPA of the students
To display the details of all students having CGPA > 9
To display the details of all CSE students with CGPA > 9
To display the details of student with maximum CGPA
To display average CGPA of each branch




import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('student.csv')

print("Dataframe head:")
print(df.head())

# 1. To find the average CGPA of the students
average_cgpa = df['CGPA'].mean()
print("\nAverage CGPA of students:", average_cgpa)

# 2. To display the details of all students having CGPA > 9
high_cgpa_students = df[df['CGPA'] > 9]
print("\nStudents with CGPA > 9:")
print(high_cgpa_students)

# 3. To display the details of all CSE students with CGPA > 9
cse_high_cgpa_students = df[(df['Branch'] == 'CSE') & (df['CGPA'] > 9)]
print("\nCSE Students with CGPA > 9:")
print(cse_high_cgpa_students)

# 4. To display the details of the student with the maximum CGPA
max_cgpa_student = df.loc[df['CGPA'].idxmax()]
print("\nStudent with maximum CGPA:")
print(max_cgpa_student)

# 5. To display average CGPA of each branch
average_cgpa_by_branch = df.groupby('Branch')['CGPA'].mean().reset_index()
print("\nAverage CGPA of each branch:")
print(average_cgpa_by_branch)
