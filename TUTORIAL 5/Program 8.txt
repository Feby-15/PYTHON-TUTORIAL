Q.8) Given a file “auto.csv” of automobile data with the fields index, company,
body-style, wheel-base, length, engine-type, num-of-cylinders, horsepower
average-mileage, and price, write Python codes using Pandas to
1) Clean and Update the CSV file
2) Find the most expensive car company name
3) Print all toyota car details
4) Print total cars of all companies
5) Find the highest priced car of all companies
6) Find the average mileage of all companies
7) Sort all cars by Price column ( university question)



#1) Clean and Update the CSV file


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('auto.csv')

print("Original Data:")
print(df.head())
df.replace('?', pd.NA, inplace=True)

numeric_cols = ['wheel-base', 'length', 'num-of-cylinders', 'horsepower', 'average-mileage', 'price']
for col in numeric_cols:
    df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors='coerce')

df.dropna(inplace=True)

df.to_csv('cleaned_auto.csv', index=False)



#2) Find the most expensive car company name

most_expensive_car = df.loc[df['price'].idxmax()]
print(f"Most Expensive Car Company: {most_expensive_car['company']} with price {most_expensive_car['price']}")


#3) Print all Toyota car details

toyota_cars = df[df['company'] == 'toyota']
print("Toyota Car Details:")
print(toyota_cars)


#4) Print total cars of all companies


total_cars = df['company'].value_counts()
print("Total Cars of All Companies:")
print(total_cars)

#5) Find the highest priced car of all companies


highest_priced_car = df.loc[df['price'].idxmax()]
print("Highest Priced Car:")
print(highest_priced_car)


#6) Find the average mileage of all companies

average_mileage = df['average-mileage'].mean()
print(f"Average Mileage of All Companies: {average_mileage}")

#7) Sort all cars by Price column


sorted_cars = df.sort_values(by='price', ascending=True)
print("Cars Sorted by Price:")
print(sorted_cars)
